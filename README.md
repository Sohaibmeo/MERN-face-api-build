**Proof-of-Concept (PoC):**
**Objective:**

Validate the feasibility and functionality of building a face recognition app using MongoDB as the database.
**Key Components:**

Implement basic user authentication and profile creation.
Develop functionalities for users to upload images for face recognition using face-api.js or similar libraries.
Utilize MongoDB for storing user data, descriptors, and metadata associated with recognized faces.
Establish basic communication between the frontend (built with React) and backend (Node.js with Express.js) to handle image uploads, recognition requests, and data storage using MongoDB.
Framework and Technology Stack (MERN with MongoDB):
**Frontend with React:**

Utilize React.js for creating an interactive and responsive user interface.
Also using Bootstrap for UI Framework
**Backend with Node.js and Express.js:**

Implement the server-side logic, API endpoints, and interactions with MongoDB.
Use Express.js for routing and handling requests.
**Database: MongoDB (replacing PostgreSQL):**

Utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL document-oriented database, for storing user data, descriptors, and metadata associated with face recognition.
Leverage MongoDB's schema flexibility for managing unstructured data related to face recognition tasks.
Face Recognition and Image Processing:

Use **face-api.js** or similar libraries for face detection, recognition, and landmark detection tasks on the client side. Leverage Node.js for server-side image pre-processing tasks if needed.
Steps to Replace PostgreSQL with MongoDB:
Setup and Configuration:

**Install and configure MongoDB** in your development environment.
Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible for your Node.js backend.
Database Interaction:

Modify your backend logic to interact with MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL. Update data models, queries, and interactions to accommodate MongoDB's document-based structure.
**Testing and Validation:**

Conduct thorough testing in a development environment to validate the functionality of your application with MongoDB.
Ensure proper integration of MongoDB for storing user-related data, descriptors, and metadata associated with face recognition.
